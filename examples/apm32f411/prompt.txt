# REQUEST
# =======
You are given a chapter from the `APM32F411` MCU reference manual. Here is "the chapter":

# ======= BEGIN CHAPTER ======= #



# ======= END CHAPTER ======= #

Based on "the chapter", you should update registers in the SVD file of the MCU. I'll give you an SVD
snippet of one register. This is how you process the register:

    - Retain the `<name>` value as-is.

    - Add or update the `<displayName>` tag with the full name of the register. Expand it if it is
    an acronym.

    - Add or update the `<description>` tag with an accurate description from "the chapter". It
    should clarify what the register does/means, but don't list all the bitfields here (as they
    will get their description later on, in their own tags, see further).

    - Retain the `<addressOffset>` value as-is.

    - Retain the `<size>` value as-is.

    - Retain the `<access>` value as-is or add it based on "the chapter".

    - Retain the `<protection>` value as-is or add it based on "the chapter".

    - Retain the `<resetValue>` value as-is or add it based on "the chapter".

    - Retain the `<resetMask>` value as-is or add it based on "the chapter".

The last tag of the register is the `<fields>` tag. In there, the bitfields are defined (every
`<field>` tag represents one bitfield). This is how you'll process each `<field>` tag:

    - Retain the `<name>` value as-is.

    - Add or update the `<displayName>` tag with the full name of the bitfield. Expand it if it is
    an acronym.

    - Add or update the `<description>` tag with an accurate description from "the chapter". It
    should clarify what the bitfield does/means, in a rather general way. The explanation of what
    each *value* means, belongs to the `<enumeratedValues>` tag (see further).

    - Retain the `<bitOffset>` value as-is.

    - Retain the `<bitWidth>` value as-is.

    - Retain the `<access>` value as-is or add it based on "the chapter".

    - Add or update `<enumeratedValues>` with enumerations for the bitfield based on "the chapter".
    Within each `<enumeratedValue>` tag should be the following four tags:
        - `<name>`: Choose a logical name, based on "the chapter".
        - `<displayName>`: If the former is an acronym, give the fully expanded name here.
        Otherwise, still provide the `<displayName>` tag, but give it the same content as the
        `<name>` tag.
        - `<description>`: Describe what the value means.
        - `<value>`: The value of the bitfield.

    - Add or update the vendor extension tag for the bitfield, to indicate if it is a "runtime" or a
    "setting" bitfield. For example:
    ```
    <vendorExtensions>
      <embeetle:fieldKind>runtime</embeetle:fieldKind>
    </vendorExtensions>
    ```
    A setting bitfield is a bitfield that you'd typically configue in an initialization function for
    the given peripheral, for example enabling an interrupt. A runtime bitfield would rather be used
    in "runtime functions" that you invoke to do things with the peripheral (eg. send or receive
    data, ...) *after* it has been initialized.

    - Finally, add `<embeetle:fieldKindCmt>` tag under the `<embeetle:fieldKind>` tag to explain
    why you chose for either "runtime" or "setting".

Ready? Let's start with updating this register:
